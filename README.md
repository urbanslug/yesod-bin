#yesod-bin

### Usage

* run `stack build`
* You can run the binary with `${PWD}/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-2.21/7.8.4/bin/yesod <argument>`

### Working with wai-devel
* Generate a scaffold with `${PWD}/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-2.21/7.8.4/bin/yesod init`
* Then run `stack build` to install dependencies(a one off thing). After that you can run wai-devel freely.
